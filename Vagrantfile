  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
   vb.gui = true
   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
   vb.memory = 4096
   # Customize CPU cap
   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "70"]
   # Customize number of CPU
   vb.cpus = 2
   # Customize VM name
   vb.name = "testing"
   # Disable usb 2.0
   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--usb", "on"]
   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--usbehci", "off"]
